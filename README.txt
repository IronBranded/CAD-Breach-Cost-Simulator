## 🛡️ Executive Overview
In the current threat landscape, a "breach" is more than just downtime—it is a complex financial event. As an IR Analyst and SOC Coordinator, I developed this simulator to help organizations visualize the hidden costs of a compromise.

### Key Calculation Vectors:
* **Incident Scenarios:** Ransomware (Double Extortion), BEC, Data Leaks, and Insider Threats.
* **Industry Multipliers:** Specialized weighting for High-Risk sectors (Healthcare, Finance, Energy).
* **Regulatory Impact:** Built-in logic for **Law 25 (Quebec)** fine risks and PIPEDA-compliant notification costs.
* **Operational Loss:** Real-world downtime estimates based on 2025 Canadian benchmarks.

## 📊 Methodology
The simulation logic is informed by a combination of academic research at **Polytechnique Montréal** and industry-standard reports (IBM, Sophos, Coveware).

### The Formulaic Approach
The simulator uses a weighted impact matrix:
> $$TotalCost = (TechResponse) + (Legal/Regulatory) + (BusinessImpact)$$

| Vector | Rate/Logic |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Technical IR** | Calculated at a standard Canadian IR rate of **$450/hr**. |
| **Legal Counsel** | Privacy Coach / Breach Counsel rates at **$600/hr**. |
| **Fraud/Extortion** | Scaled based on annual revenue brackets and data volume. |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5 & CSS3 (Modern Flexbox/Grid).
* **Styling:** "Midnight Security" UI with a dynamic CSS donut chart.
* **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6) for real-time cost modeling.
